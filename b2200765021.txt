My name is Kemal, I study at Hacettepe University and I live with my mom and dad.
I am learning programming languages since 2020. I want to focus on AI in the medical field.

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course and website;
I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been 
discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have already been
asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns
about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours
